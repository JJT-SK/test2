const RESPONSES: Record<string, string> = {
  "How can I improve my sleep quality?": 
    "Based on your data, try: 1) Keeping a consistent sleep schedule, 2) Reducing blue light exposure 2 hours before bed, 3) Maintaining bedroom temperature between 65-68Â°F, and 4) Considering magnesium glycinate supplementation before sleep.",
  
  "What factors affect my sleep the most?": 
    "Your data shows the strongest correlations between poor sleep and: 1) Late screen usage (after 10pm), 2) Caffeine consumption after 2pm, and 3) Evening exercise. Try adjusting these factors to see improvements.",
  
  "What time should I go to bed for optimal sleep?": 
    "Your sleep quality scores are highest when you go to bed between 10:00-10:30pm. Your body seems to follow natural circadian rhythms with optimal wake time around 6:00-6:30am.",
  
  "Why do my energy levels drop in the afternoon?": 
    "Your data shows an afternoon energy dip around 2-3pm. This may be related to: 1) Post-lunch insulin response, 2) Dehydration through the day, and 3) Natural circadian rhythm dips. Try a short walk after lunch and staying well-hydrated.",
  
  "How can I maintain consistent energy throughout the day?": 
    "For more consistent energy: 1) Space protein intake evenly throughout the day, 2) Stay hydrated (aim for 2-3L of water), 3) Take short movement breaks every 90 minutes, and 4) Consider adaptogens like Rhodiola Rosea.",
  
  "What supplements might help with energy levels?": 
    "Based on your profile: 1) B-complex vitamins in the morning, 2) CoQ10 (100-200mg daily), 3) Creatine monohydrate (5g daily), and 4) Consider cordyceps mushroom extract. Always consult your healthcare provider before starting new supplements.",
  
  "What practices boost cognitive performance?": 
    "Your data shows cognitive peaks when you: 1) Get 7-8 hours of quality sleep, 2) Perform cardiovascular exercise in the morning, 3) Practice 10-15 minutes of meditation, and 4) Work in 90-minute focused blocks with short breaks.",
  
  "How does my focus compare to other biohackers?": 
    "Your focus metrics place you in the top 30% of biohackers on our platform. Your consistency is excellent, though your peak performance could be improved through protocol optimization.",
  
  "Can you recommend a stack for better focus?": 
    "A potentially effective stack based on your profile: 1) L-theanine (200mg) with coffee, 2) Alpha-GPC (300mg), 3) Bacopa monnieri (300mg standardized extract), and 4) Lion's Mane mushroom. Start with one at a time to assess individual effects."
